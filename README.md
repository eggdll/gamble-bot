# gamble-bot
shitty discord gambling bot i made

# setup
Nothing is really needed, just edit the token (currently its configured for easy deployment on replit) and run `composer install`, that's it. The database is local (even though i will probably rewrite it to use sql), and is stored in a json file, that is created automatically on startup

# note
The code is really bad and unorganized, i didn't care enough to make it good. **Use at your own risk**.
